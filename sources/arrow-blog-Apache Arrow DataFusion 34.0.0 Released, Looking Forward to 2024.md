# Apache Arrow DataFusion 34.0.0 Released, Looking Forward to 2024

---

Published 19 Jan 2024   
By [The Apache Arrow PMC (pmc)](https://arrow.apache.org)

## Introduction

We recently [released DataFusion 34.0.0](https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/34.0.0). This blog highlights some of the major improvements since we [released DataFusion 26.0.0](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/06/24/datafusion-25.0.0/.) (spoiler alert there are many) and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months.

[Apache Arrow DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), that uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries, machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion‚Äôs primary design goal](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals) is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/) and [command line SQL tool](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html).

This may also be our last update on the Apache Arrow Site. Future updates will likely be on the DataFusion website as we are working to [graduate to a top level project](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/6475) (Apache Arrow DataFusion ‚Üí Apache DataFusion!) which will help focus governance and project growth. Also exciting, our [first DataFusion in person meetup](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/discussions/8522) is planned for March 2024.

DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between `26.0.0` and `34.0.0`, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517 of them. You can find a list of all changes in the detailed [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/datafusion/CHANGELOG.md).

# Improved Performance üöÄ

Performance is a key feature of DataFusion, DataFusion is more than 2x faster on [ClickBench](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) compared to version `25.0.0`, as shown below:
![Fig 1: Adaptive Arrow schema architecture overview.](https://arrow.apache.org/img/datafusion-34.0.0/compare-new.png) **Figure 1** : Performance improvement between `25.0.0` and `34.0.0` on ClickBench. Note that DataFusion `25.0.0`, could not run several queries due to unsupported SQL (Q9, Q11, Q12, Q14) or memory requirements (Q33). ![Fig 1: Adaptive Arrow schema architecture overview.](https://arrow.apache.org/img/datafusion-34.0.0/compare.png) **Figure 2** : Total query runtime for DataFusion `34.0.0` and DataFusion `25.0.0`.

Here are some specific enhancements we have made to improve performance:

* [2-3x better aggregation performance with many distinct groups](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/08/05/datafusion_fast_grouping/)
* Partially ordered grouping / streaming grouping
* [Specialized operator for ‚ÄúTopK‚Äù `ORDER BY LIMIT XXX`](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7721)
* [Specialized operator for `min(col) GROUP BY .. ORDER by min(col) LIMIT XXX`](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7192)
* [Improved join performance](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/8126)
* Eliminate redundant sorting with sort order aware optimizers

# New Features ‚ú®

## DML / Insert / Creating Files

DataFusion now supports writing data in parallel, to individual or multiple files, using `Parquet`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `ARROW` and user defined formats. [Benchmark results](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7655) show improvements up to 5x in some cases.

Similarly to reading, data can now be written to any [`ObjectStore`](https://docs.rs/object_store/0.9.0/object_store/index.html) implementation, including AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, local files, and user defined implementations. While reading from [hive style partitioned tables](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/listing/struct.ListingTable.html#features) has long been supported, it is now possible to write to such tables as well.

For example, to write to a local file:  

    ‚ùØ CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE awesome_table(x INT) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '/tmp/my_awesome_table';
    0 rows in set. Query took 0.003 seconds.

    ‚ùØ INSERT INTO awesome_table SELECT x * 10 FROM my_source_table;
    +-------+
    | count |
    +-------+
    | 3     |
    +-------+
    1 row in set. Query took 0.024 seconds.
You can also write to files with the [`COPY`](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/dml.html#copy), similarly to [DuckDB‚Äôs `COPY`](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/copy.html):  

    ‚ùØ COPY (SELECT x + 1 FROM my_source_table) TO '/tmp/output.json';
    +-------+
    | count |
    +-------+
    | 3     |
    +-------+
    1 row in set. Query took 0.014 seconds.
    $ cat /tmp/output.json
    {"x":1}
    {"x":2}
    {"x":3}
## Improved `STRUCT` and `ARRAY` support

DataFusion `34.0.0` has much improved `STRUCT` and `ARRAY` support, including a full range of [struct functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/scalar_functions.html#struct-functions) and [array functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/scalar_functions.html#array-functions).

For example, you can now use `[]` syntax and `array_length` to access and inspect arrays:  

    ‚ùØ SELECT column1, 
             column1[1] AS first_element, 
             array_length(column1) AS len 
      FROM my_table;
    +-----------+---------------+-----+
    | column1   | first_element | len |
    +-----------+---------------+-----+
    | [1, 2, 3] | 1             | 3   |
    | [2]       | 2             | 1   |
    | [4, 5]    | 4             | 2   |
    +-----------+---------------+-----+
    ‚ùØ SELECT column1, column1['c0'] FROM  my_table;
    +------------------+----------------------+
    | column1          | my_table.column1[c0] |
    +------------------+----------------------+
    | {c0: foo, c1: 1} | foo                  |
    | {c0: bar, c1: 2} | bar                  |
    +------------------+----------------------+
    2 rows in set. Query took 0.002 seconds.
## Other Features

Other notable features include:

* Support aggregating datasets that exceed memory size, with [group by spill to disk](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/7400)
* All operators now track and limit their memory consumption, including Joins

# Building Systems is Easier with DataFusion üõ†Ô∏è

## Documentation

It is easier than ever to get started using DataFusion with the new [Library Users Guide](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/index.html) as well as significantly improved the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/index.html).

## User Defined Window and Table Functions

In addition to DataFusion‚Äôs [User Defined Scalar Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/adding-udfs.html#adding-a-scalar-udf), and [User Defined Aggregate Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/adding-udfs.html#adding-an-aggregate-udf), DataFusion now supports [User Defined Window Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/adding-udfs.html#adding-a-window-udf) and [User Defined Table Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/library-user-guide/adding-udfs.html#adding-a-user-defined-table-function).

For example, [the `datafusion-cli`](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html) implements a DuckDB style [`parquet_metadata`](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html#supported-sql) function as a user defined table function ([source code here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/3f219bc929cfd418b0e3d3501f8eba1d5a2c87ae/datafusion-cli/src/functions.rs#L222-L248)):  

    ‚ùØ SELECT 
          path_in_schema, row_group_id, row_group_num_rows, stats_min, stats_max, total_compressed_size 
    FROM 
          parquet_metadata('hits.parquet')
    WHERE path_in_schema = '"WatchID"' 
    LIMIT 3;

    +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
    | path_in_schema | row_group_id | row_group_num_rows | stats_min           | stats_max           | total_compressed_size |
    +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
    | "WatchID"      | 0            | 450560             | 4611687214012840539 | 9223369186199968220 | 3883759               |
    | "WatchID"      | 1            | 612174             | 4611689135232456464 | 9223371478009085789 | 5176803               |
    | "WatchID"      | 2            | 344064             | 4611692774829951781 | 9223363791697310021 | 3031680               |
    +----------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
    3 rows in set. Query took 0.053 seconds.
### Growth of DataFusion üìà

DataFusion has been appearing more publically in the wild. For example

* New projects built using DataFusion such as [lancedb](https://lancedb.com/), [GlareDB](https://glaredb.com/), [Arroyo](https://www.arroyo.dev/), and [optd](https://github.com/cmu-db/optd).
* Public talks such as [Apache Arrow Datafusion: Vectorized Execution Framework For Maximum Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJU9rdRNk9I) in [CommunityOverCode Asia 2023](https://www.bagevent.com/event/8432178)
* Blogs posts such as [Apache Arrow, Arrow/DataFusion, AI-native Data Infra](https://www.synnada.ai/blog/apache-arrow-arrow-datafusion-ai-native-data-infra-an-interview-with-our-ceo-ozan), [Flight, DataFusion, Arrow, and Parquet: Using the FDAP Architecture to build InfluxDB 3.0](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/flight-datafusion-arrow-parquet-fdap-architecture-influxdb/), and [A Guide to User-Defined Functions in Apache Arrow DataFusion](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guide-user-defined-functions-apache-arrow-datafusion-dade-aderemi/)

We have also [submitted a paper](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/6782) to [SIGMOD 2024](https://2024.sigmod.org/), one of the premiere database conferences, describing DataFusion in a technically formal style and making the case that it is possible to create a modular and extensive query engine without sacrificing performance. We hope this paper helps people evaluating DataFusion for their needs understand it better.

# DataFusion in 2024 ü•≥

Some major initiatives from contributors we know of this year are:

1. *Modularity* : Make DataFusion even more modular, such as [unifying built in and user functions](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/8045), making it easier to customize DataFusion‚Äôs behavior.

2. *Community Growth*: Graduate to our own top level Apache project, and subsequently add more committers and PMC members to keep pace with project growth.

3. *Use case white papers*: Write blog posts and videos explaining how to use DataFusion for real-world use cases.

4. *Testing*: Improve CI infrastructure and test coverage, more fuzz testing, and better functional and performance regression testing.

5. *Planning Time* : Reduce the time taken to plan queries, both [wide tables of 1000s of columns](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/7698), and in [general](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/5637).

6. *Aggregate Performance* : Improve the speed of [aggregating ‚Äúhigh cardinality‚Äù](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/7000) data when there are many (e.g. millions) of distinct groups.

7. *Statistics* : [Improved statistics handling](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/8227) with an eye towards more sophisticated expression analysis and cost models.
