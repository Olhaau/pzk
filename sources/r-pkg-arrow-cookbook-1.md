## Preface

![](https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/r/images/arrow.png "Apache Arrow logo")

This cookbook aims to provide a number of recipes showing how to perform common tasks using [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/). This version of the cookbook works with arrow >= 6.0.0, but in future we will maintain different versions for the last few major R package releases.  

## What is Arrow?

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory analytics.  
The arrow R package provides a low-level interface to much of the functionality available in the C++ implementation, as well as a higher-level interface to the compute functionality via an implementation of the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) API.
