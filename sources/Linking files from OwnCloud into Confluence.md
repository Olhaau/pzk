I have Confluence server and OwnCloud server. Owncloud is where all of our users network folders are located. The Research and Marketing team would like to make it easy to reference these files within Confluence pages. I've not yet found an easy way for them.

Is there a webdav client / macro for Confluence that I can add to a page to link to Owncloud?

When I look at google drive integrations there is one we've tried. It allows you to create a google drive folder and then on Confluence, link that folder to the page using the macro. Does anything like this exist for Confluence/OwnCloud?
