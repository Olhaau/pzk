## Overview

Posit Workbench provides flexible configuration to allow administrators to securely manage session sandboxes. When properly configured, users are provisioned with a secure application development environment that includes Linux terminal access, using existing accounts, groups, servers, and shared file systems.

There are many aspects to consider when deploying Workbench into your environment, and you should evaluate each of these areas based on your deployment scenario. These include:

* Network port, address, and IP access rules
* Browser considerations (Frame origin, cookies, and other browser compatibility)
* SSL
* Server account and permissions
* Proxy configurations
